# t9p

t9p is a relatively small (originally tiny) 9p2000.L client supporting RTEMS and Linux.
This client was designed with older RTEMS systems in mind (single core, <=512M memory, PowerPC or m68k).

## Building

### Integrating with Other Projects

t9p's source files require no special defines or include dirs to build, so they can be trivially included in other projects in a variety of ways.

Platform specific source files will need to be excluded manually (i.e. do not build t9p_rtems.c if you are targeting Linux).

### Configuring

A makefile is provided that can automatically configure for all targets.
```sh
make -f Makefile.conf configure
```

If the RTEMS_TOP environment variable is set to the top of your RTEMS 6 install, Makefile.conf will automatically determine the available targets
and configure for those.

The build-cmake directory will contain all of the build subdirs. It is safe to delete.

### Building All


The makefile can also build all targets:
```sh
make -f Makefile.conf build
```

### Configuring Manually


#### Linux

```sh
cmake . -Bbuild
make -C build -j$(nproc)
```

Alternatively, you can use Makefile.conf (this will configure for all available targets):
```sh
make -f Makefile.conf configure
```

Makefile.conf will generate `build-cmake/build-linux-x86_64` for Linux.

#### RTEMS 6

Example shown is RTEMS6-pc686-qemu target.
```sh
cmake . -Bbuild-cmake/build-rtems6-pc686-qemu -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=rtems-tools/toolchains/rtems6-pc686-qemu.cmake -DRTEMS_TOP=$HOME/dev/rtems/6.0
make -C build-cmake/build-rtems6-pc686-qemu -j$(nproc)
```

Running in QEMU is done with this script:
```sh
./tests/rtems-test.sh -t rtems6-pc686-qemu
```

NOTE: you will need qemu-system-i386 to be installed and available in your PATH.


#### RTEMS 4


Configuring for RTEMS 4.X is similar:
```sh
cmake . -Bbuild-cmake/build-rtems4-pc586 -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=rtems-tools/toolchains/rtems4-pc586.cmake -DRTEMS_TOP=path/to/your/rtems/4.10.2
make -C build-cmake/build-rtems4-pc586
```

Running in QEMU can be done by the following script:

```sh
./tests/rtems-test.sh -t rtems4-pc586
```

NOTE: you will need qemu-system-i386 to be installed and available in your PATH.

## Target Environment

This client has been tested on the following targets:
- linux-x86_64
- linux-powerpc (testing only)
- RTEMS4/6-mvme3100 (PowerPC, soft FP)
- RTEMS4/6-mvme6100 (PowerPC, hard FP, altivec)
- RTEMS4/6-uC5282 (m68k, Coldfire ISA-A)

We will also need to test the client on:
- RTEMS4-svgm (PowerPC, soft FP [for VGM-1D] and hard+altivec [for VGM5])

Compilers:
- GCC 4.8.5 (RTEMS 4)
- GCC 13.2.0 (RTEMS 6)
- whatever else you are building with on host system

## Testing

### Targets

- Host system (linux-x86_64)
- qemu-powerpc-static (user-space Linux PowerPC emulation)
- rtems4-pc586 (QEMU)
- rtems6-pc686-qemu (QEMU)
- Actual hardware (mvme-3100, 6100, uC5282, svgm)

### Test Applications

- t9p_cmd: interactive cli for interacting with 9p
- t9p_threaded_test: threaded validation and performance testing
- t9p_rtems_test: Combines an automated test with t9p_cmd on RTEMS target

### Running Tests

1. Run ./tests/mktree.sh to create a test file system tree
2. Run ./tests/diod.sh in a new terminal
3. Run ./tests/t9p.sh, t9p-threaded.sh or rtems-test.sh

### Testing on Hardware

Integrated ssrlApps/GeSys build at: /sdf/group/cds/sw/epics/users/lorelli/rtems/4.10.2/src/ssrlApps

Set your nvram config to point at this image:
- mvme3100: /sdf/group/cds/sw/epics/users/lorelli/rtems/4.10.2/target/rtems_p5/ssrlApps_p4/powerpc-rtems/mvme3100/bin/rtems.ralf
- mvme6100: /sdf/group/cds/sw/epics/users/lorelli/rtems/4.10.2/target/rtems_p5/ssrlApps_p4/powerpc-rtems/beatnik/bin/rtems.ralf
- uC5282: TODO

t9p.obj gets loaded automatically on boot.

Mounting example:
```
p9Mount("16626.2211@134.79.217.70", "/scratch/lorelli/dummy-diod-fs", "/test")
```
Must be mounted with correct uid/gid. IP required right now, that needs fixing.

## Development Guidelines

- Use C99, plus GNU extensions (but don't do anything crazy with the GNU extensions)
- Generally follow the formatting guidelines
- Leave plenty of comments
- Validate your changes with manual testing before committing them
- Open issues for bugs+improvements

| mkdir         | Y |   |
| renameat      | Y |   |
| unlinkat      | Y |   |

The xattr calls are likely not going to be implemented, as they are not needed for the primary use-case of this client.

Implementation percentage: 22/28 (78%)
